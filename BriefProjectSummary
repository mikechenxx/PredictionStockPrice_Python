This project uses Machine Learning in order to make equity price prediction for the next day. 

The python program uses historical equity data from Yahoo Finance API to train the model, then using Machine learning to predict equity openning and closing 
price of the next day and compares this predicted price model to actual equity prices.   

Tools used to design this project include Python for data analysis, Machine Learing toolkit for prediction training and Yahoo Finance API for historical equity data.

you have training data time period (10yrs), then use test data (3yrs) to test how well it does based on the 10yr data we fed it, then 
use the last 60days in order to predict one day into the future (1 day)
